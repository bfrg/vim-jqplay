## Usage

### Quick Overview

| Command                   | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:Jqplay [{args}]`        | Start an interactive session using the current buffer and the jq options `{args}`.|
| `:JqplayScratch [{args}]` | Like `:Jqplay` but use a new scratch buffer as input.               |
| `:Jqrun [{args}]`         | Invoke jq manually with the jq options `{args}`.                    |
| `:JqplayClose`            | Stop the _jqplay_ session.                                          |
| `:JqplayClose!`           | Stop the _jqplay_ session and delete all associated scratch buffers.|
| `:Jqstop`                 | Terminate a running jq process.                                     |

### Run jq whenever input or filter buffer are modified

Running `:Jqplay {args}` on the current json buffer opens two new windows:
- The first window contains a `jq` scratch buffer prefixed with `jq-filter://`
  that is applied interactively to the current json buffer.
- The second window displays the `jq` output, prefixed with `jq-output://`.

`{args}` can be any `jq` command-line arguments as you would write them in the
shell (except for the `-f` and `--from-file` options and the filter).

Jq will run automatically whenever the json input buffer or the `jq` filter
buffer are modified. By default `jq` is invoked when the `InsertLeave` or
`TextChanged` events are triggered. See [configuration](#configuration) below on
how to change the list of events.

**Note:** `:Jqplay` can be run only on json buffers, unless the
`-n`/`--null-input` and/or `-R`/`--raw-input` options have been passed.

If you want to start a _jqplay_ session with a new input buffer, run
`:JqplayScratch`. The command will open an interactive session in a new tab page
using a new json scratch buffer as input.

### Run jq manually on demand

Use `:Jqrun {args}` at any time to invoke `jq` manually with the `jq` arguments
`{args}` and the current `jq-filter://` buffer. This will temporarily override
the `jq` options previously set with `:Jqplay {args}`. Add a bang to `:Jqrun!`
to permanently override the options for the `jq-filter://` buffer.

`:Jqrun` is useful to quickly run the same `jq` script with different set of
`jq` arguments.

Alternatively, if you don't want to run `jq` interactively on every buffer
change, disable all autocommands and use `:Jqrun` instead.

**Note:** The command is available only after starting a _jqplay_ session with
`:Jqplay` or `:JqplayScratch`, and is deleted after the session is closed.

### Close jqplay or stop a jq process

Running `:JqplayClose` will stop the interactive session. The `jq` filter
buffer and the output buffer will be kept open. Run `:JqplayClose!` with a bang
to stop the session and also delete the buffers. Think of `:JqplayClose!` as _I
am done, close everything!_

`jq` processes previously started with `:Jqplay` or `:Jqrun` can be stopped at
any time with `:Jqstop`.


## Configuration

Options are set in either the buffer-local dictionary `b:jqplay`, or the
global dictionary `g:jqplay`.

**Note:** The buffer-variable `b:jqplay` needs to be specified for `json`
filetypes, for example, in `after/ftplugin/json.vim`

The following entries can be set:

| Key        | Description                 | Default                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `exe`      | Path to `jq` executable     | value found in `$PATH`           |
| `opts`     | Default `jq` arguments      | -                                |
| `autocmds` | Events when `jq` is invoked | `["InsertLeave", "TextChanged"]` |

If you don't want to run `jq` interactively on every buffer change, set
`autocmds` to an empty list and run `:Jqrun` manually.


## Examples

#### Example 1: `g:jqplay`

Use the local `jq` executable and tabs for indentation. Invoke `jq` whenever
insert mode is left, text is changed in normal mode, or when user doesn't press
a key in insert mode for the time specified with `updatetime`:
```vim
" in vimrc
let g:jqplay = {
    \ 'exe': '~/.local/bin/jq',
    \ 'opts': '--tab',
    \ 'autocmds': ['TextChanged', 'CursorHoldI', 'InsertLeave']
    \ }
```

#### Example 2: `b:jqplay`

Use tabs for indentation, do not run `jq` automatically on buffer change.
Instead invoke `jq` manually with `:Jqrun`:
```vim
" in after/ftplugin/json.vim
let b:jqplay = { 'opts': '--tab', 'autocmds': [] }
```
